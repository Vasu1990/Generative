# Functional Requirements Document

## Project Overview
A Streamlit-based web application that compares sports equipment across multiple e-commerce platforms (Dick's Sporting Goods and Academy Sports) to provide comprehensive product insights and competitive analysis, enhanced with AI-powered insights using Google's Gemini AI.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Data Collection
#### 1.1 Product Search
- Must support search functionality across both retailers simultaneously
- Search parameters:
  - Search term (required)
  - Store selection (both stores by default)
  - Product category (if available)

#### 1.2 Data Scraping
- **Dick's Sporting Goods**
  - Endpoint: Product search API
  - Required data:
    - Total product count
    - Facets/filters
    - Product attributes
  - Rate limiting: Implement appropriate delays between requests
  - Error handling for API failures

- **Academy Sports**
  - Endpoint: Product search API
  - Required data:
    - Total product count
    - Facets/filters
    - Product attributes
  - Rate limiting: Implement appropriate delays between requests
  - Error handling for API failures

### 2. Data Processing
#### 2.1 Data Extraction
- Extract relevant information from API responses:
  - Product counts
  - Available filters/facets
  - Filter values and their counts
- Standardize data format across both retailers
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully

#### 2.2 Data Combination
- Merge data from both retailers maintaining store-specific attribution
- Combine similar facets when possible
- Preserve individual store metrics
- Handle mismatched attributes between stores

### 3. User Interface
#### 3.1 Search Interface
- Clean, intuitive search input
- Default search term suggestion
- Clear search button
- Search history (optional)
- Loading indicator during search

#### 3.2 Results Display
- Side-by-side comparison of stores
- Metrics display:
  - Total product counts per store
  - Available filter counts
- Expandable sections for detailed filter views
- Sort options for filter values:
  - Alphabetical
  - Count (descending)

#### 3.3 Debug Features
- Toggle for raw API response viewing
- Error messages for failed requests
- Request timing information (optional)
- Colored logging output in console
- Log files for different components:
  - Application logs
  - Scraper logs
  - AI analysis logs

#### 3.4 AI Insights Interface
- "Get Insights" button prominently displayed next to metrics
- Loading indicator during AI analysis
- Structured display of AI-generated insights:
  - Key findings section
  - Detailed analysis sections
  - Actionable recommendations
- Option to download insights as markdown
- Visual separators between insights and facet data
- Tabbed interface for organized insights display

### 4. Technical Requirements
#### 4.1 Performance
- Maximum search response time: 5 seconds
- Graceful timeout handling
- Caching of recent searches (optional)
- Efficient data processing

#### 4.2 Error Handling
- Clear error messages for:
  - API failures
  - No results found
  - Invalid search terms
  - Rate limiting
  - AI analysis failures
- Fallback behavior when one store fails
- Comprehensive error logging with context

#### 4.3 Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- No exposure of internal API details
- Proper rate limiting
- Secure handling of API responses

#### 4.4 AI Integration
- Integration with Google's Gemini AI
- Proper API key management through environment variables
- Prompt template management in version control
- Error handling for AI responses
- Response caching for similar queries
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Fallback options if AI service is unavailable
- Configurable model parameters:
  - Temperature
  - Maximum output tokens
  - Model selection

#### 4.5 Logging System
- Separate loggers for different components
- Color-coded log levels
- Both file and console output
- Timestamp-based log files
- Detailed error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Request/response logging
- AI analysis logging
