# Generative AI Projects

This repository is a collection of projects and experiments exploring the capabilities of Generative AI, with a focus on building intelligent chatbots and agents using various frameworks and libraries.

## Projects

### 1. LangChain Chatbots

This section contains several chatbot implementations built using the [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) framework.

- **Simple Chatbot**: A basic conversational AI.
- **History-Aware Chatbot**: A chatbot that maintains conversation history for context.
- **Chain-based Chatbot**: An implementation using LangChain's chain capabilities.
- **Resume Chatbot**: A chatbot designed to answer questions based on a resume, using ChromaDB for vector storage.

### 2. OpenAI Resume Bots

This section explores different approaches to building a resume-parsing chatbot using OpenAI's tools.

- **ResumeBot using OpenAI Library**: A resume chatbot built directly with the core OpenAI Python library. It can analyze a resume and answer questions about it.
- **ResumeBot using OpenAI Agent SDK**: An implementation that uses the more advanced OpenAI Agent SDK to create a more sophisticated and interactive resume bot.

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own `README.md` and `requirements.txt` file. Please refer to those for specific setup and usage instructions.
